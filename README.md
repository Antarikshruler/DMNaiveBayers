Prediction of Click Through Rates of a given Advertisement: In online advertising, click-through rate (CTR) is a very important metric for evaluating ad performance. As a result, click prediction systems are essential and widely used for sponsored search and real-time bidding. Thus in this project I implemented and predicted the click through rate on the dataset of a company known as Avazu , who had provided 11 days worth of their real time data. I predicted the click through rate of the advertisement using Na√Øve Bayers theorem assuming that the attributes were independent of each other.
